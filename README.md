## Overview
I have developed an application that identifies the music being played and runs locally on a Raspberry Pi device situated in front of my record player. This app allows me to discover the track information of the music I'm listening to in real-time.

Using https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-audio-visualizers for the visualizer. Using https://pypi.org/project/shazamio/ for the track identifier.

## Getting Started

Run the front end. Navigate to the now-play dir in Terminal.
Execute:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Run the back end. Open a new Terminal. Navigate to the app dir in Terminal.
Execute:
```bash
python3 app.py
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Enjoy!
